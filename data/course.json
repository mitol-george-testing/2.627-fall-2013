  "course_description": "Fundamentals of photoelectric conversion: charge excitation, conduction, separation, and collection. Lectures cover commercial and emerging photovoltaic technologies and cross-cutting themes, including conversion efficiencies, loss mechanisms, characterization, manufacturing, systems, reliability, life-cycle analysis, risk analysis, and technology evolution in the context of markets, policies, society, and environment.\n\nThis course is one of many [OCW Energy Courses](/courses/energy-courses/), and it is an elective subject in MIT's undergraduate [Energy Studies Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor/). This Institute\u2013wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.\n",
