**Description:** Theoretical efficiency limits. Materials and device-related efficiency loss mechanisms. Simulation of solar cell performance. Optical losses, recombination losses (and photon recycling), surface recombination velocity, series and parallel resistance (shunts). Band offset losses (both internal junctions and external contacts). Contact-related losses.

Second in-class debate: Elemental Resource Abundance: Engineering Issue, Political Issues, or Non-Issue?

**Instructor:** Prof. Tonio Buonassisi
